### Methods

We obtained sequencing data from the roommate's influenza virus infection from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession number SRR1705851. Additionally, three isogenic control samples of the influenza A (H3N2) virus were acquired to assess the background sequencing error rates. These controls were also sourced from the SRA with accession numbers SRR1705858, SRR1705859, and SRR1705860.

The quality of the sequencing data was evaluated using SeqKit [1], which provided metrics such as the number of reads, average read length, and total bases sequenced. 
We retrieved he reference sequence for the influenza A virus hemagglutinin gene (GenBank accession number KF848938.1) from the NCBI database. The reference genome was indexed using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) version 0.7.17 [2] to facilitate efficient alignment of sequencing reads.

We alligned sequencing reads from the roommate's sample and the control samples to the indexed reference genome using the BWA-MEM algorithm with default parametres [2]. The alignments were processed using SAMtools version 1.11 [3] to convert SAM files to BAM format, sort the alignments, and index the sorted BAM files for downstream analyses.
We performed variant calling was performed using VarScan version 2.3.9 [4] on mpileup files generated by SAMtools. To create the mpileup files, we used the `mpileup` function of SAMtools with the `-d 100,000` parameter to set the maximum read depth per position to 100,000, ensuring that high-coverage regions were fully represented.

To identify common variants that might represent mutations prevalent in the viral population infecting the roommate, we used VarScan  with a minimum variant frequency threshold of 95% (`--min-var-freq 0.95`). Default parameters were used for other settings, including a minimum coverage of 8 reads and a minimum average base quality of 15. Variants identified at this frequency were considered high-frequency variants. VarScan reported four high-frequency single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) after filtering.

To detect rare variants potentially present at low frequencies, we used  VarScan with a minimum variant frequency threshold of 0.1% (`--min-var-freq 0.001`) with the same default parameters for minimum coverage and average base quality.

The three isogenic control samples were processed identically to the roommate's sample. Reads were aligned to the reference genome using BWA-MEM, and the resulting BAM files were sorted and indexed using SAMtools. Mpileup files were generated with the same maximum read depth parameter (`-d 100,000`), and VarScan was used to call variants with a minimum variant frequency threshold of 0.1%.

We extracted variant frequencies from the control samples and compiled it into a dataset for statistical analysis. Variants with frequencies less than 10% were considered for calculating the average background error rate and standard deviation, as higher-frequency variants might represent systematic errors or contamination rather than random sequencing errors. Common high-frequency variants (frequency ≥90%) were excluded from this calculation to avoid skewing the error rate estimation.

We compared  variants identified in the roommate's sample with the background error rates derived from the control samples. Variants in the roommate's sample with frequencies exceeding three standard deviations above the mean error rate were considered statistically significant and likely to represent true biological mutations rather than sequencing artifacts.
Significant mutations were annotated to determine their potential impact on the HA protein. The nucleotide changes were translated into amino acid substitutions using the standard genetic code. The positions of these mutations were mapped onto the HA protein sequence to assess their potential functional significance.

The identified mutations were cross-referenced with known antigenic epitopes of the HA protein as described by Muñoz et al. [5]. Mutations located within or adjacent to epitope regions were highlighted, as these could affect antibody recognition and contribute to immune escape mechanisms.

We used Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) version 2.8.2 [6]  to visualize the alignments and mutations in the context of the reference genome. This allowed for manual inspection of the sequencing data to validate the computational findings and assess the quality of the variant calls.
